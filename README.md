# AnimationEngine
Class project where we had to create a Animation Engine from a library given by the school

## TO DO :

- Edit this ReadMe.txt into a ReadMe.md for a better presentation on GitHub
- File this ReadMe with more information about the project
- Create an input manager to permit a dynamic swap beetween different functionnalities
- Take out the loop for blend ratio form the main file
- Add a Debug Draw mod to display bones and joints. Add a wireframe mod to see them
- Add a frozen transition mode instead of a smooth transition
- Deal with different algorithm for animations interpolation
- Implement Dual Quaternion skinning
