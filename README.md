#Animation Engine

This is a class project made in 5 days only, the purpose of this one was to discover how to implement animation into a game engine

## Features I wanted to implement

- Create an input manager to permit a dynamic swap beetween different functionnalities
- Take out the loop for blend ratio from the main file and use input manager instead
- Add a Debug Draw mod to display bones and joints
- Add a wireframe mod
- Add a frozen transition mod.
- Try different algorithm for animations interpolation.

## Libraries

- [WhiteBoxEngine](https://github.com/Trizek/WhiteBoxEngine): 3D engine created by a professor for this project
- libMaths : mathematic library created by me classmates and me (other school project we will need to use on our own game engine)

## Platforms and configurations

- Due to the WhiteBoxEngine this project only work on Windows 32 bits. 
- Use Visual Studio to open the project
